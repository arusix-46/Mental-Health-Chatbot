# Mental-Health-Chatbot

## Hope Dataset Chatbot using T5-Base

### Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a chatbot using the T5-Base model to assist in mental health conversations. The chatbot is trained on the Hope Dataset, enabling it to generate contextually aware and emotionally adaptive responses.

## Methodology

1. Data Processing

Preprocessed therapist-patient dialogues from the Hope Dataset.

Applied dialogue act and emotion tagging for improved context understanding.

2. Model Implementation

Utilized the T5-Base transformer model for response generation.

Fine-tuned the model on structured conversation data.

3. Training & Optimization

Paired patient utterances with appropriate therapist responses.

Optimized model training for improved response accuracy and efficiency.
